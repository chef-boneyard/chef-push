# Maintainers

This file lists how the Chef Push Jobs project is maintained. When making changes to the system,
this file tells you who needs to review your patch - you need a simple majority of
maintainers for the relevant subsystems to provide a :+1: on your pull request. Additionally,
you need to not receive a veto from a Lieutenant or the Project Lead.

Check out [How Chef is Maintained](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc030-maintenance-policy.md#how-the-project-is-maintained) for details on
the process, how to become a maintainer, lieutenant, or the project lead.
